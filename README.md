# Infrastructure Automation with Terraform and GitHub Actions

CI-CD with Terraform and GitHub Actions
![alt text](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f17f8fd2-48aa-4e02-9e84-50909b6ec124)

## Introduction
This repository provides a comprehensive guide and a set of resources to create and manage infrastructure using **Terraform** and automate the deployment process with **GitHub Actions**.

**Terraform** is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.

**GitHub Actions** is a powerful automation and CI/CD platform provided by GitHub that enables automated workflows, including infrastructure provisioning and deployment.

## Project Flow
By combining Terraform and GitHub Actions, you can:

✅ **Define Infrastructure as Code**: Specify infrastructure components like virtual machines, databases, and networks in a Terraform configuration file.

✅ **Automate Deployment**: Use GitHub Actions workflows to automatically deploy infrastructure changes whenever the Terraform configuration is updated.

✅ **Version Control**: Maintain your infrastructure code under version control to collaborate efficiently with your team.

✅ **Follow Best Practices**: Adhere to infrastructure as code best practices, including versioning, code reviews, and documentation.

This project serves as a **starting point** for automating infrastructure deployment and management, offering a structured approach to Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
- [AWS CLI / Azure CLI / GCP SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (depending on your cloud provider)

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manas-raj999.git
   cd manas-raj999
   ```
2. **Initialize Terraform**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
3. **Plan Infrastructure Changes**
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
4. **Apply Changes**
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
5. **Destroy Infrastructure (if needed)**
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

## GitHub Actions Workflow
This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow to automate Terraform deployment. The workflow:
- Runs on every push to the `main` branch.
- Validates Terraform code.
- Applies changes automatically after approval.

### Workflow Configuration
You can find the workflow in `.github/workflows/terraform.yml`. Modify it based on your requirements.

### Running the Workflow
1. Commit your Terraform files.
2. Push changes to GitHub.
3. The workflow will trigger automatically.

## Best Practices
- Use **remote state management** (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB for AWS, Azure Storage for Azure) to store Terraform state securely.
- Implement **GitHub Actions secrets** to manage credentials securely.
- Use **Terraform modules** to structure your infrastructure code.
- Follow **code reviews and approvals** before applying changes in production.
